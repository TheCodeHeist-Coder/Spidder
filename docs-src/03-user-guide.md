## Part 1 — Running Spidder

### Start it

You need **Docker** and nothing else.

```bash
git clone <repo-url> spidder
cd spidder
docker compose up --build
```

Open **<http://localhost:3001>**.

First boot takes a few minutes: it builds the images, applies the database
schema, seeds the problems, and installs the Python 3.12 runtime into the code
sandbox. All of that is automatic. Later starts take seconds.

You'll know it's ready when the logs settle and the page loads.

### Stop it

```bash
docker compose down          # keep the database
docker compose down -v       # wipe the database too
```

### If a port is already in use

The usual culprit is **Redis on 6379**, if you already run one locally.

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env
echo "REDIS_PORT=6380" >> .env
docker compose up
```

Compose reads `.env` automatically. `POSTGRES_PORT` and `PISTON_PORT` work the
same way. Everything has a working default, so only add the lines you need.

For running without Docker, see **[SETUP.md](../SETUP.md)**.

## Part 2 — Hosting a battle

### Create a room

1. Open <http://localhost:3001>.
2. Enter a display name. That's the whole sign-up — no email, no password.
3. Create a battle. You'll get a **room code** (six characters, e.g. `UVPT2K`).
4. Share that code with your opponent.

Room codes deliberately avoid `0`, `O`, `1`, and `I`, so they're unambiguous
when you read one out loud across a room.

### Join a room

1. Open the site, enter a display name.
2. Choose to join, and enter the room code.

Anyone with the code can join. There's no invite list — this is designed for
people who are already together in a room or on a call.

### Start the match

In the lobby, both players:

1. **Pick a side** — Team A or Team B.
2. **Ready up.**

The host can start once both sides are seated, evenly sized, and ready. The
server enforces this — you can't start a lopsided or half-ready battle.

A countdown runs, then both sides receive the **same problem** at the same
moment.

## Part 3 — Playing

### The arena

Once the battle starts you'll see the problem statement, an editor, and a
timer. Your opponent has exactly the same problem.

Write your solution and submit. Each submission is queued, run against the
hidden tests in a sandbox, and the verdict comes back to you.

### What you see, and what they see

| You see                                  | Your opponent sees      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Your full verdict — passed/failed counts | Your passed-count only  |
| Your own code                            | *Nothing* of your code  |

That asymmetry is deliberate. You get enough to feel the race — knowing they're
at 4/5 while you're at 2/5 is the whole point — without anything you could use
to copy their approach.

The hidden tests are never shown to anyone, including you. You see how many
passed, not what they were.

### Submitting

You can submit as many times as you like before the clock runs out. Only your
**best** submission counts.

### How you win

| Outcome      | What happened                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ALL_PASSED` | You passed every test — **instant win**, battle ends |
| `TIMEOUT`    | Clock expired — **highest passed-count wins**     |

If both sides finish the clock on the same passed-count, the tie breaks in
favour of whoever **reached that count first**, measured by when the server
received the submission.

Practically: if you're stuck at 4/5 with a minute left, keep submitting — an
earlier 4/5 beats a later one.

### Results

When the battle ends both sides see the final standings: the winner, the reason,
and each side's best passed-count. Results are saved, so the record survives a
page refresh.

## Part 4 — Reference

### Ports

| Service   | URL                         |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Web       | <http://localhost:3001>     |
| HTTP API  | <http://localhost:4001>     |
| WebSocket | `ws://localhost:4002/ws`    |
| Piston    | <http://localhost:2000>     |
| Postgres  | `localhost:5432` (loopback) |
| Redis     | `localhost:6379` (loopback) |

### Current limits

- **1v1 only.** Team modes 2v2–4v4 exist in the data model and rules but are
  gated in the UI.
- **Python 3.12 only.**
- **Three seeded problems** ship by default: *Sum of Two Numbers*, *Reverse a
  String*, *Count Vowels*. Each battle is assigned one deterministically from
  its battle ID, so every player in a given room provably gets the same problem
  — and a room can be replayed identically.

### Adding your own problems

Problems and their hidden tests live in `packages/db/prisma/seed.ts`. Add
entries there, then re-run the seed:

```bash
pnpm --filter @repo/db db:seed
```

To browse or edit the data directly:

```bash
pnpm --filter @repo/db db:studio
```

## Part 5 — Troubleshooting

### The page won't load

Give it a minute on first boot — image builds plus provisioning take a while.
Then check everything is up:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

All services should be `running`; `db-init` and `piston-init` should show
`exited (0)` — that's success, they're one-shot setup containers.

### Submissions hang or every test fails

The sandbox has no language runtime. Check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:2000/api/v2/runtimes
```

You should see Python 3.12. If the list is empty, `piston-init` didn't finish —
check its logs:

```bash
docker compose logs piston-init
```

### "Port is already allocated"

Something else is using one of the ports. See
[If a port is already in use](#if-a-port-is-already-in-use).

### The battle won't start

The server refuses to start an invalid lobby. Confirm both sides are seated,
the teams are the same size, and **everyone** has readied up.

### I want to start completely fresh

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

`-v` drops the database volume, so the schema and problems are re-seeded from
scratch.

### Checking service health

```bash
curl http://localhost:4001/health   # -> {"ok":true}
curl http://localhost:4002/health   # -> {"ok":true}
```

### Reading logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f              # everything
docker compose logs -f ws-server    # one service
docker compose logs -f judge-worker # judging problems
```
