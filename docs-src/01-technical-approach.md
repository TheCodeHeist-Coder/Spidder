## 1. System overview

Spidder is a pnpm/Turborepo monorepo containing four runtime services and five
shared packages. The browser holds two connections: REST to `http-api` for
transactional work, and a long-lived WebSocket to `ws-server` for the battle.

### Service responsibilities

| Service        | Owns                                                        | Explicitly does *not*             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `web`          | Rendering, input, optimistic UI                             | Any authoritative state           |
| `http-api`     | Guest auth, battle creation/join, result reads              | Live gameplay                     |
| `ws-server`    | **All** game state: seats, readiness, timer, scoring, outcome | Executing code                    |
| `judge-worker` | Running submissions, producing verdicts                     | Deciding who wins                 |

The separation between the last two is the core design decision: **the referee
never executes code, and the executor never decides outcomes.**

---

## 2. The authority model

Every piece of contestable state lives on `ws-server`. Clients send *intent*;
the server decides what actually happened.

| Client sends       | Server decides                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `team:select`      | Whether that seat is free and the battle is open |
| `player:ready`     | Whether the lobby is now startable               |
| `battle:start`     | Whether the requester is the host and rules pass |
| `code:submit`      | The submission's server-side timestamp           |

A client cannot mark itself ready, award itself a point, set its own submission
time, or end a battle. There is no client-supplied timestamp anywhere in the
scoring path — `submittedAt` is stamped on receipt by the server and is, per
`packages/game/src/outcome.ts`, *"the sole tie-break authority."*

### Why this matters for scoring

The outcome rule is: **highest passed-count wins; ties break by who reached that
count first.** If clients supplied their own timestamps, every tie would be
winnable by lying. Server-stamped receipt time closes that.

### Deterministic problem assignment

Problems are not chosen randomly per battle. `battleRoom.ts` selects from the
candidates for the room's difficulty using **`battleId` as the seed**, so the
assignment is reproducible: every participant provably receives the same
problem, and a battle can be replayed or audited without storing the choice
separately.

---

## 3. Wire protocol

All frames are Zod-validated in both directions (`packages/protocol`). An
invalid frame is rejected, not coerced.

**Client → server:** `hello` · `team:select` · `player:ready` · `battle:start` ·
`code:submit` · `battle:leave` · `ping`

**Server → client:** `snapshot` · `lobby:update` · `presence:update` ·
`battle:countdown` · `battle:start` · `timer:tick` · `submission:queued` ·
`submission:result` · `opponent:progress` · `battle:finished` · `ack` ·
`ack-error` · `error` · `pong`

### The opponent-safety boundary

`opponent:progress` is documented in `packages/protocol/src/messages.ts` as
*"The ONLY progress signal opponents receive (no source)."* It carries a
passed-count and nothing else — no code, no test names, no failure output.

This is enforced by the schema, not by convention. There is no field on the
opponent-facing message that *could* carry source, so a future change that tries
to leak it fails type-checking in both the client and the server.

### Reconnection

`snapshot` carries full current state, letting a client that drops mid-battle
rebuild without special-case recovery logic. The server is the single source of
truth, so replaying state is just sending it again.

---

## 4. The judging pipeline

Executing untrusted code is both **dangerous** and **slow**. Those are two
different problems with two different solutions.

    ├─ queue.add ───────►│                       │                   │

    │                    │                       ├─ load testcases   │
    │                    │                       │  (Postgres)       │
    │                    │                       │                   │
    │                    │                       ├─ execute ────────►│
    │                    │                       │◄─ stdout/exit ────┤

    │                    │                       │                   │
    │                    │◄──── publish ─────────┤ write verdict     │
    │◄─── subscribe ─────┤   (RESULT_CHANNEL)    │ (Postgres)        │
    │                    │                       │                   │
    ├─ apply game rules  │                       │                   │
    ├─ push to both sides│                       │                   │
```

**Danger → isolation.** Code runs in a Piston container, never in the app
processes. `judge-worker` is the only service that talks to it.

**Slowness → decoupling.** Execution takes hundreds of milliseconds per test. A
game server that blocks on that stops sending timer ticks to *everyone in the
room*. So submissions become BullMQ jobs; the socket path stays hot regardless
of judge load, and workers scale independently (`JUDGE_CONCURRENCY`).

### Defensive limits

`apps/judge-worker/src/judge/piston.ts` applies:

- `run_timeout` / `compile_timeout` — passed to Piston per execution
- an `AbortController` on the HTTP call (`httpTimeoutMs`) so a hung sandbox
  can't wedge a worker
- **output truncation** — commented in-source as ensuring *"one runaway print
  can't blow up memory"*

Jobs use `jobId: submissionId`, making enqueue idempotent: a retry or duplicate
frame cannot double-judge one submission.

## 5. Data model

Eight Prisma models (`packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`):

```
User ──< TeamMember >── Team ──< Battle
                                  │
Problem ──< TestCase              ├──< Submission
                                  └──< Result
```

| Model        | Role                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `User`       | Guest identity. **No password field** — guest-only    |
| `Problem`    | Statement and metadata                                |
| `TestCase`   | Hidden inputs/outputs. Read only by `judge-worker`    |
| `Battle`     | Room, mode, lifecycle state, timing                   |
| `Team`       | Side A or B within a battle                           |
| `TeamMember` | Seat: which user on which team                        |
| `Submission` | One attempt, with server-stamped `submittedAt`        |
| `Result`     | Final standings and deciding submission               |

Battle lifecycle: `LOBBY → IN_PROGRESS → FINISHED`.

Guest-only play is **structural, not policy** — there is no credential column to
misuse, so there is no password to leak.

---

## 6. Type and validation strategy

Two shared packages are compiled into both the frontend and the backend:

- **`packages/protocol`** — Zod schemas for every REST body and socket frame
- **`packages/game`** — pure functions for lobby readiness, scoring, and outcome

This is what prevents client/server drift. A protocol change that breaks a
client surfaces as a **type error at build time**, not as a mystery bug during
someone's tournament.

Keeping the rules pure also makes the part that decides winners the part that's
easiest to verify: `packages/game` is unit-tested in isolation, no database, no
sockets (9 tests in `outcome.test.ts`).

Validation is applied at *every* boundary — REST bodies, socket frames in both
directions, and jobs pulled off the queue (`JudgeJob.parse`). Nothing is trusted
because it arrived over a channel that was trusted a moment ago.

---

## 7. Deployment

Each app ships two Dockerfiles:

| Variant           | Build                                    | Purpose                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `Dockerfile.dev`  | 3 stages, source bind-mounted            | Hot reload                 |
| `Dockerfile.prod` | 5–6 stages, `turbo prune`, non-root user | Slim, reproducible runtime |

`turbo prune` isolates each app's dependency subtree, so an unrelated app's
change doesn't invalidate the install cache. The result is measurable — `web`
is **331 MB** in prod versus **1.19 GB** in dev.

### One-command startup

Two init containers make `docker compose up` sufficient:

- **`db-init`** — applies the schema, seeds problems
- **`piston-init`** — installs the Python 3.12 runtime into the sandbox

Both are **idempotent** (the provisioner checks the installed-runtime list
before POSTing) and both are gated behind healthchecks, so no app service can
start against an unmigrated database or an empty sandbox.

---

## 8. Known constraints

- **1v1 is what ships.** 2v2–4v4 exist in schema, protocol, and rules, but are
  gated in the UI pending a larger-roster lobby flow.
- **Python only.** Adding a language means adding it to `PISTON_RUNTIME` in
  `packages/protocol/src/enums.ts` *and* the provisioner list — they must match.
- **Single ws-server instance.** Battle state is in-process. Horizontal scaling
  would need room affinity or state extraction to Redis.
- **No rate limiting on submissions** beyond queue concurrency.
