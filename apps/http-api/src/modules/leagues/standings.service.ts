/**
 * Standings, qualification and round progression.
 *
 * WHERE THE THINKING LIVES
 * ------------------------
 * Almost none of it is here. Ranking teams, deciding who qualifies and
 * seeding a bracket are pure functions in @repo/game, tested exhaustively
 * without a database. This module's whole job is to fetch rows, hand them to
 * those functions, and write back what they decide.
 *
 * That split matters because "who is eliminated?" is the question a
 * tournament exists to answer, and a wrong answer tells someone they are out
 * when they are not.
 *
 * WHY A ROUND IS GENERATED, NOT INFERRED
 * --------------------------------------
 * The server never advances a league on its own. It computes who WOULD go
 * through and shows the host, who then confirms. Generating fixtures creates
 * matches that real people arrange their evening around, and a league that
 * silently moved to the semi-finals because a result landed at 3am — possibly
 * on a tie-break the host would have settled differently — is not something
 * anyone can undo.
